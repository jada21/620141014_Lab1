hello sir. this is my readme file
Each function answers the questions given in the lab. Parallel function calculates the total resistance of resistors in parallel. Potential divider() calculates the voltage drop across each resistor in a loop. Temperature check() tells whether a patient is hyperthermic or hypothermic.

there was nothing funnt about this lab.
